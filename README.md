## My Journey So Far :bike: :bike: :bike: :bike:

### Working Student: Data Scientist üñ•Ô∏è

Currently working on Predictive maintenance.
Extract and clean data from Sensors and Service reports.

### Internship at SICK Sensor Intelligence :computer:

Completed my internship with the Data Science team at SICK Sensor Intelligence, where I'm diving deep into the world of data analysis and machine learning. Some of my focus areas include:
- Data analysis and preprocessing [Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matlab etc]
- Model building and evaluation [Scikit-learn]
- Optimize hyperparameters using Optuna and Autosklearn
- Improve code quality ( Pytest, my[py], ) and project dependency management (Poetry)
- Use AI ops pipeline: DVC

### Data Management at Creditshelf AG :computer:

Previously, I worked as a working student at Creditshelf AG, contributing to data management and analysis using Python and relational databases. My key achievements involved:

- Quality control and evaluation of data using Python libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, Pytest, and Pandas
- Data analysis using PostgreSQL
- Dockerizing applications and deploying them in Kubernetes clusters
- AWS S3 for data storage, API implementation, and document classification using machine learning algorithms

### Systems Engineer at Infosys Pvt Lmt :computer:

In my role as a Systems Engineer at Infosys Pvt Lmt, I delved into DevOps practices in the retail domain. My areas of expertise include:

- Incident and Change Management
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Containerized Microservices deployment
- Monitoring using tools like Splunk, AppDynamics, and custom solutions
- Unix and Windows administration
- SLA management

## Passion for Data Science

My passion for data science led me to pursue an MSc in Data Science. I'm excited about exploring Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Big Data analysis to automate processes and enhance user experiences. 

My skill set :construction_worker:
#### Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Flask | PLSQL | Statistics | Deep Learning | Keras | tensorflow | Machine Learning | Scikit-learn

## Projects and Achievements

During my educational journey, I've undertaken several projects, including:

- End-to-end machine learning in aviation: Predicting flight fares using data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.
- Unsupervised ML for customer segmentation in the retail sector using PCA and KMeans.
- A research case study on Automated classification of activity groups using empirical motion data.

## Let's Connect!  :calling:
